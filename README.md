# Fibonacci

Please see main.java under src folder for the code.

Initial assignment was to create a function that could calculate the fibonacci sequence.
First coded function died at around number 30. Target was to get atlast 10k or 100k of numbers. It slowed down heavily at 30 which led me to come up with another solution.
Problem was that the first function was recursive which used up alot of memory. I did some research and found that tail recursion helps against that kind of problem. I kept the initial function in case it helps someone.
